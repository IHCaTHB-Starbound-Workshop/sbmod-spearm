Does not add any new items. Chance to generate blunt version ~ 1/2. Art entirely from vanilla assets.

Will not be compatible with any other mod that adds additional spear head variants, there are none that i could find, but if you experience a compatability issue let me know and i'll produce a patch ASAP.
